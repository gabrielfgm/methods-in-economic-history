## The plan

1.  I will talk about @hacking1990 on Peirce and the nature of induction
2.  Discuss: the project of @hacking1990 and what he does.
3.  Discuss:
    1.  The growth of quantification and its implications [@hacking1990; @porter1994]
    2.  What quantification does
4.  Toy exercise

## Induction and statistics

## The problem of induction

> "That the sun will *not* rise tomorrow is no less intelligible a proposition that that it will rise. We should in vain, therefore, attempt to demonstrate its falsehood." –Hume quoted in @diaconis2018

-   Inductive inferences do not follow a logical deductions from their premises

-   But surprisingly effective?

## Pierce on inference

-   Peirce is famous for contributing the idea of what he called 'abduction'

    -   Renamed by philosophers 'inference to the best explanation'

-   This is **not** a solution to the problem of induction

## Pierce on induction

> "...a process which would more often yield truth than the reverse" [@hacking1990, p. 209]

-   This is at the core of his idea

-   Inductive inference: 'the conclusion is **usually** true when the premises are true'

## Pierce on induction

> "When the premises are quantitative, we may be able to replace the 'usually' by a numerical probability. **That does not mean that conclusion has a probability of such and such.** Rather: the conclusion is reached by an argument that, with such and such a probability, gives true conclusions from true premises." [@hacking1990, p. 209 emphasis added].

-   '...Peirce was providing the core of the rationale of the theory of confidence intervals' [@hacking1990, p. 210]

#| warning: false

# 1. Set Parameters

max_sims <- max(sim_steps)

# 3. Create a combined dataset for plotting
# We duplicate rows to assign them to different "View" groups (1, 10, 100, 1000)
plot_data <- map_dfr(sim_steps, function(k) {
  
  # Slice the first k simulations
  subset_data <- master_data %>% slice(1:k)
  
  # Calculate empirical coverage for this specific subset
  coverage_rate <- mean(subset_data$captured == "Captured")
  
  # Return data with a labeling column for the facet

      facet_title = paste0("Sims: ", k, " | Coverage: ", round(coverage_rate * 100, 1), "%")
    )
})

# ensure factor order for plotting
plot_data$facet_title <- factor(plot_data$facet_title, levels = unique(plot_data$facet_title))

# 4. Plot
ggplot(plot_data, aes(y = sim_id)) +

## Discussion: @hacking1990

> "A noncommittal account of what I am attempting might
> be: an epistemological study of the social and behavioural sciences,
> with consequences for the concept of causality in the natural sciences. ...Philosophical analysis is the investigation of
> concepts. Concepts are words in their sites. Their sites are sentences
> and institutions. I regret that I have said too little about
> institutions, and too much about sentences and how they are arranged." p. 7

## Discussion

> "The transformations that I shall describe are closely connected with an
> event so all-embracing that we seldom pause to notice it: an avalanche

> their subjects anew." @hacking1990, p. 2

-   What are the consequences for the study of society of the 'avalanche of numbers'?

-   In what ways does this alter the practice of history?

## Discussion

> "Even the most elementary operation of statistics, counting, is senseless
> unless the objects counted can be mobilized and defended as
> homogeneous." @porter1994, p. 399

-   What does Porter mean by this?

-   How can quantification alter how we think about things?

## Discussion

> "In economic and social affairs, quantitative predictions and management
> by numbers often create inducements for business people, medical
> patients, taxpayers, and criminals (among others) to alter their
> behavior in a way that undermines the numbers." @porter1994, p. 401

-   How should we think about the social life of numbers?

-   What are examples of quantification altering behavior?
