    "text": "Introductions\nAbout me\nI’m a mostly quantitative economic historian. I work mostly on financial markets in the 19th century focused on London but have done some research on Paris/New York as well. I’ve also done some work on other bits of British economic history including welfare. I like quantitative methods, and think they should have a place in historical research. I’ve done a little methodological work on network econometrics, and am interested in Bayesian statistics.\nContacting me: gabriel.mesevage@kcl.ac.uk\nOffice hours: Monday 3-4, and Tuesday 11-12 in S8.13."
